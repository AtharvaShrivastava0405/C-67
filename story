story- 
a salt seller used to carry a salt bag on his donkey to the market every day.

On the way they had to cross a stream.One day the donkey tumbled down the stream and the salt bag also fell into the water.
The salt dissolved in water and hence the bag became very light to carry.The donkey was quite happy.

Then the donkey started to play the same trick everyday.

The salt seller came to know the trick and decided to teach a lesson to the donkey.

The next day he loaded a cotton bag on the donkey.

Again the donkey played the same trick hoping that the cotton bag would still become lighter but the damp cotton became very heavy to carry and the donkey suffered so much .

He learned a lesson and afterwards did not play the trick and the seller was happy.
